# REST
* Resources; Resource endpoints; Payload (request body, only in POST)

### REST Architecture Constraints
* Client–server architecture
* Statelessness => Scalable (no storing data across requests on server => servers needn't communicate with each other)
* Cacheability
* Layered system: Proxy or LB won't affect communication
* Code on demand (optional)
* Uniform interface

### Features of RESTful Web Services
* Based on Client–Server model
* Statelessness: Client request and response are not dependent on others. Client state is not maintainer on the server.
* Caching to minimize the server calls
* The medium of communication between client and server is called Messaging
* *Resources* (object in OO) are accessible by URI
* Can use SOAP

### HTTP methods
* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* PATCH
* OPTIONS

### REST methods
* Idempotent: Do not change *responses*, after calling a single request multiiple times, the outcome of the request should be the same. Ensure responses remain the same.
* Safe: Do not change *resrouces* internally
    -           Idempotent  Safe
    - GET          Yes      Yes
    - POST         No        No
    - PUT          Yes       No (Replace the original version of resource)
    - DELETE       Yes       No
    - PATCH        No        No (Apply partial change to resources. Succeeds only if the resource has not been updated)
    - OPTIONS      Yes      Yes
    - HEAD         Yes      Yes (GET but doesn't return response body)
* Example:
    - HTTP GET /device-management/managed-devices  //Get all devices
    - HTTP GET /device-management/managed-devices/{id}  //Get device for given Id
    - HTTP POST /device-management/managed-devices  //Create new Device
    - HTTP PUT /device-management/managed-devices/{id}  //Update device for given Id
    - HTTP DELETE /device-management/managed-devices/{id}  //Delete device for given Id

### Pros ann Cons
* Cons
    - Statelessness -> cannot maintain sessions
    - Does not impose security restrictions inherently -> use SSL/TLS (encrypt communication)

### SOAP vs REST (https://stoplight.io/api-types/vs-rest-api/)
* SOAP (PRC: Remote Procedure Call): imposes built-in rules(ACID)/security => complex, heavier => enterprise
    - Standards need to be followed strictly
    - tightly coupled to server
    - XML
    - Not cacheable
    - Difficult to debug
    - Remote procedure calls: getUser(23)
* REST
    - Standards not strictly followed
    - Statelessness
    - XML/JSON/MIME/Text
    - Resource-based: /user/23

### Best practice
* Resources defined by plural nouns. Singular name to represent a document resource
* Use hyphen instead of underscore
* Lower case
* JSON if possible
* Return appropriate error codes
* Use nesting to represent hierarchy of resources
    - /customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}?parm=value

### Request & Response body
* Request
    - Method, URI, HTTP Version, Header, Body
    - POST /api/2.2/auth/signin HTTP/1.1
* Response
    - Status Code, HTTP Version, Header, Body

### Query String vs Payload
* Query String
    - Purpose: Filtering(Searching & Pagination)
    - Parms that are hight dynamic, only valid for a few endpoints should go in query string. Parm staty the same on all endpoints are better suited for headers.
    - Cons: Can be read by everyone; Debugging isn't pleasant;

### Security
* By always using SSL, the authentication credentials can be simplified to a randomly generated access token ("username:password" that is encoded by base64)
