# Design Patterns

* Creational patterns
* Structural patterns
* Behavioral patterns
* Concurrency patterns


### Factory
* Creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created
```java
public class CardGame {
    public static CardGame createCardGame(GameType type) {
        if (type == GameType.Poker) {
            return new PokerGmae();
        } else if (type == GameType.BlackJack) {
            return new BlackJackGame();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Singleton
* Restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance
```java
public class Restaurant {
    public static Restaurant _instance = null;
    public static Restaurant getInstance() {
        if (_instance == null) {
            return new Restaurant();
        } 
        return _instance;
    }
}
```

### Builder
* Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
* Solve Telescoping Constructor Pattern

```java
Pizza(int size) { ... }        
Pizza(int size, boolean cheese) { ... }    
Pizza(int size, boolean cheese, boolean pepperoni) { ... }    
Pizza(int size, boolean cheese, boolean pepperoni, boolean bacon) { ... }
```

```java
public class Pizza {
  private boolean cheese;
  private boolean pepperoni;

  public static class Builder {

    private boolean cheese = false;
    private boolean pepperoni = false;

    public Builder cheese(boolean value) {
      cheese = value;
      return this;
    }

    public Builder pepperoni(boolean value) {
      pepperoni = value;
      return this;
    }

    public Pizza build() {
      return new Pizza(this);
    }
  }

  private Pizza(Builder builder) {
    cheese = builder.cheese;
    pepperoni = builder.pepperoni;
  }
}
Pizza pizza = new Pizza.Builder().cheese(true).pepperoni(true).build();
```

### Adaptor
* Match interfaces of different classes
* Impedance match an old component to a new system

```java
interface Shape {
    public int calculateArea(int r);
}

class Square implements Shape {
    @Override
    public int calculateArea(int r) {
        return r * r;
    }
}

class Circle {
    public double calculateCircularArea (int r) {
        return 3.14 * r * r;
    }
}

// open closed principle, but not really
// logic is already there in class Circle
class CircleAdaptor extends Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public int calculateArea(int r) {
        return (int) calculateCircularArea(r);
    }
}
```

### Decorator
* Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* Adding additional functionality to an existing object (i.e. already instantiated class at runtime). Add functionality to a single object and leave others like it unmodified

### Facade
* Simplifies interface to the overall functionality of a complex subsystem
```java
/* Complex parts */

class CPU {
    public void freeze() { ... }
    public void jump(long position) { ... }
    public void execute() { ... }
}

class Memory {
    public void load(long position, byte[] data) { ... }
}

class HardDrive {
    public byte[] read(long lba, int size) { ... }
}

/* Facade */

class ComputerFacade {
    private CPU processor;
    private Memory ram;
    private HardDrive hd;

    public ComputerFacade() {
        this.processor = new CPU();
        this.ram = new Memory();
        this.hd = new HardDrive();
    }

    public void start() {
        processor.freeze();
        ram.load(BOOT_ADDRESS, hd.read(BOOT_SECTOR, SECTOR_SIZE));
        processor.jump(BOOT_ADDRESS);
        processor.execute();
    }
}

/* Client */

class You {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComputerFacade computer = new ComputerFacade();
        computer.start();
    }
}
```

### Observer
* A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
* Similar to React state

### Chain of Responsibility
* A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

### Strategy
* Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Open-closed principle
* Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
