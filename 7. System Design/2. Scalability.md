# Scalability

###### when we increase the resources in a system, it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added -> serving more units of work/handle larger units of work

### Vertical / Horizontal Scaling
* Vertical: increase resources of a specific node
* Horizontal: increase the number of nodes

### Load Balancer (Solving Horizontal Scaling)
* Look at Availability: Fail-over
* Provide SSL and session persistence (sticky session)
* Round Robin
* Network Redundancy

### Cache (Solving unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes by Round-Robin LB)
* Where:
    - Client/CND/Web Server/Database/Application
* Categories:
    - Query level: delete & recache; hard to delete with complex queries
    - Object level: allow asynchronous processing (when assemble) | remove when data changed
* When to update:
    - Cache-aside: noticable delay; data stale; fail & replace
    - Write-through: no stale; slow overall fast subsequent | data never read; new node cache until update
    - Write-behind: data loss; more complex
    - Refresh-ahead: not accurately predicting: reduced performance
* Cons:
    - maintain consistency
    - application logic change
    - additional complexity with cache invalidation (when to update)

### DB Partitioning (Doesn't have big enough server to handle several communities)
* Replication
    - Look at Availability: Relication
* Federation
    - less read/write to each DB; less replication lag; more cache hit; no single writer master | not effective if huge functions; logic to determine which to write; expensive joins; hardware & complexity
* Sharding
    - up 4; other still operational if one goes down | complex application logic; complex joins; data distribution lopsided, complex rebalance; hardware & complexity
* Denormalization
    - improve read at the expense of write; overcome complex joins | duplicated data; perform worse under heavy writes; constraints to keep in sync


### Security
* Encryption
* XSS (Cross-site scripting) and SQL injection
    - Sanitize user inputs
    - Parameterized queries
* Principle of least privilege
    - An entity should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more
