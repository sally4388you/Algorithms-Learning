# System Design Overview
##### System Design is all about scaling.

- Availability
- Stability
- Scalability


### Ask about requirements
- How many users/writes/reads are we talking about?
- Latency: What are the latency requirements for sender -- receiver message delivery?
- Storage: How are you going to store messages?
- Update frequency


### Availability

* CAP
    - network partition failure: cancel / proceed
    - CP: atomic ｜ timeout error
    - AP: eventual consistency, continue despite error ｜ not latest

* Consistency
    - weak/eventual/strong

* Availabity: no single point failure
    - fail-over (server heartbeats)
        - active-passive
        - active-active
        - cons: hardware & complexity; potential data loss
    - replication
        - master-slave: promote slave to master
        - master-master: LB; loosely consistent or increased latency cuz synchronizatioin; conflict resolution
        - cons: hardware & complexity; potential data loss; write in parallel, read in a single thread; replication lag; read replicas bogged down with replaying writes
