## Interview Tips

### Coding Tips
* Things to consider:
    - Test cases
    - Edge cases/Boundary
    - Time complexity
* Same cases split into different directions
* Naming
* Requirements -> Solution -> Corner cases -> Test

### System Design
1. Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions
2. Create a high level design
3. Design core components
4. Scale the design


### Algorithm
* Panlindome
    - n ^ 2
    - Initialize for single-character and double-character strings
* DP
    - Define the state
        - dp[i][j] contains current result
        - dp[i][j] where i, j are the index in the given two sequences respectively
        - dp[i] jump game
    - Increase one more dimenstion
* Scheduling Problem
    - HashMap/TreeMap
